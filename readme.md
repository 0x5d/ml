# ML Notebooks

Some Jupyter notebooks for the 2 books I'm reading to learn about ML:

- [Grokking Deep Learning](https://github.com/castillobgr/ml/tree/master/grokking-deep-learning)
- [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn, Keras and Tensor Flow](https://github.com/castillobgr/ml/tree/master/hands-on-ml)
